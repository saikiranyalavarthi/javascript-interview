         <h1>Day 1 JavaScript Preparation</h1>
        <b>1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</b>
        <span>ans. "==" and "===" both comes under relational operator.
            "==" :The == operator means "is equal to," matching by value only.
            "===":The === operator means "is exactly equal to," matching by both value and data type.

        <b>2.What is the spread operator?</b>
        <span>ans.The JavaScript spread operator is denoted like this (...) and
            used to expand or iterables which is introduced in 2015 Es6.
            it allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

            1.Creation Phase.
            2.Execution Phase.

            * When memory is allocates what does it stores means a special value called <b>"undefined"</b>
            * once code execution starts the "undefined" is updated with the value assigned to the Variable. 
            * In case of functions it literally stores whole code of the function inside memory space.
              once it starts to execute another execution context is created inside the global execution context.

        <b>5.What is meant by first class functions</b>
        <span>ans. it is also called as first class citizenFirst-Class Function: A programming language is said to have First-class functions.
            if functions in that language are treated like other variables. 
            So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function

        <b>6.What are closures? Give an example of closure</b>
        <span>ans.A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
